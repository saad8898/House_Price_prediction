# House Price Prediction

## Objective
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning regression techniques.

## Dataset
The project uses the California Housing dataset from Scikit-learn.

## Data Science Aspect
This project exemplifies key elements of data science, including:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
   - The project utilizes a real-world dataset to analyze housing data, a crucial step in any data science endeavor.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to examine relationships between various features (e.g., number of rooms, population) and the target variable (house prices).

3. **Modeling**:
   - The project implements machine learning algorithms, specifically Linear Regression and Random Forest, to develop predictive models based on historical data.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - The models are evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared, which assess their performance in predicting house prices.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizations, including scatter plots comparing actual and predicted prices, help interpret the results and communicate findings effectively.
